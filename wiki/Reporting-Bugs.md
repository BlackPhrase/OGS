# Reporting Engine Bugs

How to use the bug report:

Where to send bug reports: [Here](https://github.com/headcrab-garage/OpenGoldSrc/issues)

If possible, start the engine with the "-condebug" command line parameter
and try to reproduce the bug. Attach the "qconsole.log" file found in the
game directory to the end of the bug report. If the bug is sound related,
while in game, execute the "soundinfo" command from
the console.

Please attach a copy of your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT file to the end of
the report.

Bugs submitted properly with this form will get attention.
Unformatted ones will be ignored.
If you see problems, please take the time to do this.

If you do not have all of the information requested in the form,
don't worry. Send what you do have.

Please include the engine version number. It can be found in the
lower right hand corner of the console. To bring up the console, press the
tilde ("~") key. Press tilde again or ESC to exit.
