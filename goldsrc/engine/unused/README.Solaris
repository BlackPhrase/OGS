Solaris 2 Quake / QuakeWorld
----------------------------

	This is an UNSUPPORTED version of Quake and QuakeWorld.  Don't
	bother id software about it.  Bug reports will be ignored.
	
PORT DETAILS
------------

	In order to use this program, you need the files pak0.pak 
	and pak1.pak in the id1 directory found on a registered copy of
	Quake.  You can ftp them to your Solaris host from a Windows95
	machine for example.  The files must be in an id1 subdirectory from
	the directory you install Quake/QuakeWorld, and all file names must
	be lowercase.  Add on packages such as ThreeWave CTF work fine as
	well, just place such addon packages in their own directory as you
	would on a Windows95 installation.  But again, make sure all files
	are lowercase.
			
	COMMAND LINE FLAGS:
	
	+pixel_multiply 
	
		You can magnify the screen by using this flag:
		
		Ex: % quake +pixel_multiply 2
		
		You can also use this command (without the dash)
		from the Quake console.  pixel_multiply is a Quake
		cvar and is saved from session to session in the
		config.cfg file.

	-winsize <width> <height>

		Set the size of the window when you start

	-count_frames

		See how many frames per second you're getting

	GAME SETTINGS

	mouse binding

		You can bind and unbind the mouse to the Quake window
		by using the Use Mouse selection in the Options menu,
		or with the "_windowed_mouse" command in the console,
		ex "_windowed_mouse 1" Now, moving the mouse will move
		your player.  Use "_windowed_mouse 0" to unbind.  You
		can bind or alias this to a key.  

	Example command:

		% quake.xil +pixel_multiply 2 -winsize 400 300

WHAT IS "QUAKEWORLD" AND HOW DO I USE IT?
-----------------------------------------

	In a nutshell, QuakeWorld is an extension of Quake that is
	much more user friendly.  It allows the user to dynamically
	download changes from the server, such as new maps and new
	weapons while inside the Quake client.  It is not directly
	compatible with Quake (ie, you can't connect to a Quake server
	from a QuakeWorld client) but in general it is superior to
	Quake.  QuakeWorld also offers much smoother play over the 
	Internet by using client prediction.

	Example command:

		% qwcl.xil +pixel_multiply 2 -winsize 400 300
