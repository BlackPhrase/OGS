- Autodownload support is in.  The following items will be automatcally
  downloaded as needed:
    - world map (and textures)
    - models
    - sounds (precached ones)
    - plug in player model, skin, skin_i and weapon.md2
  downloads go to a temp file (maps/blah.tmp for example) and get renamed
  when done.  autoresume is supported (if you lose connect during the
  download, just reconnect and resume).  Server has fine control over
  the downloads with the following new cvars:
    allow_download - global download on/off
    allow_download_players - players download on/off
    allow_download_models - models download on/off
    allow_download_sounds - sounds download on/off
    allow_download_maps - maps download on/off
  maps that are in pak files will _not_ autodownload from the server, this
  is for copyright considerations.
  The QuakeWorld bug of the server map changing while download a map has
  been fixed.
- Added flood protection.  Controlled from the following cvars:
   flood_msgs - maximum number of messages allowed in the time period
                specified by flood_persecond
   flood_persecond - time period that a maximum of flood_msgs messages are
                     permitted
   flood_waitdelay - amount of time a client gets muzzled for flooding
- IP banning support ala QW.  It's built into the game dll as 'sv' console
  commands.  This list is:
    sv addip <ip-mask>  - adds an ip to the ban list
	sv listip <ip-mask> - removes an ip from the ban list
	sv writeip - writes the ban list to <gamedir>/listip.cfg.  You can
	  exec this on a server load to load the list on subsequent server runs.
	  like so:  quake2 +set dedicated 1 +exec listip.cfg
	sv removeip <ip-mask> - remove an ip from the list
  the ip list is a simple mask system.  Adding 192.168 to the list
  would block out everyone in the 192.168.*.* net block.  You get 1024 bans,
  if you need more, recompile the game dll. :)
  A new cvar is also supported called 'filterban'.  It defaults to one which
  means "allow everyone to connect _except_ those matching in the ban list."
  If you set it to zero, the meaning reverses like so, "don't allow anyone
  to connect unless they are in the list."
