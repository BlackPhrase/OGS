5. Why does GLQuake try to connect to my Internet connection whenever
it starts?

GLQuake uses Windows networking. Auto-Dial is likely enabled in your
Internet Control Panel or in Internet Explorer Options.  Single
Player users: To disable Network use in GLQuake and prevent the
network connection screen from coming up, add "-nolan" to the
GLQUAKE.EXE command line, example:
	GLQUAKE.EXE -nolan



7. Mouse input seems jumpy, how do I fix that?

From the console (hit the ~ tilde key), enter m_filter 1 <enter>
This option can be added to the AUTOEXEC.CFG file (in the \ID1
directory).  You may also add this option to the GLQUAKE.EXE command
line, example:
	GLQUAKE.EXE +m_filter 1



8. While playing GLQuake the sound stutters, how do I fix it?

If your sound card does not support DirectSound, you may encounter
stuttering sound during game play.  Try adding the following value to
the CONFIG.CFG file (in the quake\ID1 directory):
		 _snd_mixahead ".14"



9. When I hit ALT-TAB or the Windows start button to switch to another
application why do I return to a 640x480 display?

GLQuake by default needs to keep the 2D display at 640x480 while it is
running. To return the display to your normal setting you must exit
GLQuake.  To prevent this, add the following to the GLQUAKE.EXE command
line options "+_windowed_mouse 1" and "-window"   example:
	GLQUAKE.EXE +_windowed_mouse 1 -window

11. GLQuake multiplayer slows down alot, how do I fix it?

Add gl_playermip 2 to the AUTOEXEC.CFG file (in the \ID1 directory)
You may however add "+gl_playermip 2" to the GLQUAKE.EXE command line,
example:
	GLQUAKE.EXE +gl_playermip 2
