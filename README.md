Clean open source reimplementation of the GoldSource game engine  
Based on original Quake (Id Tech 2) engine sources

## Mini-Q&A

**Q: So no using of reverse-engineered code at all?**  
**A:** Nope, only backtrace logs and a lot of researching of original GS engine history

**Q: How much the GoldSource engine is different from original Quake engine?**  
**A:** Let's say it's pretty much a "dieselpunk" version of Quake engine

**Q: What are the "backtrace logs"?**  
**A:** Call stack of the latest called program functions/class methods before crash of the program. 
This information allows you to see which function caused the crash and its location in source code. 
(Backtrace logs don't show you the actual source code)
