# GoldSource Killer

Clean reimplementation of the GoldSource game engine (common base for OpenGS/Magenta/ReplicaSource engines)

## Mini-Q&A

**Q: So no using of reverse-engineered code at all?**  
**A:** Nope, only backtrace logs and a lot of researching of original GS engine history

**Q: How much the GoldSource engine is different from original Quake engine?**  
**A:** Let's say it's pretty much a "dieselpunk" version of Quake engine

**Q: What are the "backtrace logs"?**
**A:** Call stack of the latest called program functions/class methods before the crash of the program. This information allows you to see which function was called and its location in source code 
(they don't show you the actual source code)
